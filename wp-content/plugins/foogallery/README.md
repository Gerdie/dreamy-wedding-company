Foo Gallery is the most intuitive and extensible gallery management tool ever created for WordPress. Now with albums!

## Description ##

Foo Gallery allows for better image gallery management within WordPress. Built to be simple for users and highly flexible for developers.

Our #1 goal with Foo Gallery was to utilize as much of the core image handling functionality that already exists in WordPress.

The result is an intuitive gallery creation and management experience that is easy to use and lightweight and fast.

## Video Support ##

Foo Gallery now supports the creation of video galleries with the [FooVideo premium extension](http://fooplugins.com/plugins/foovideo/?utm_source=foogalleryplugin&utm_medium=foogallerylink&utm_campaign=foogallery_wprepo)! Create galleries with both images and videos mixed!

## Albums Built In ##

Albums are now built in as an extension. Simply head over to the extensions page and activate the albums extension. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.

## Built For Developers ##
